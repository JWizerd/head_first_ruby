this is my practice exercises and projects for the O'Reilly Head First Ruby textbook.

# 1. Number Game 
	
	This first number game commit was my first attempt at creating my own number game. For this exercise I chose not to look even look at the text to see how they accomplished creating the logic for the game. I just got the idea that the user had 10 guesses to pick a number between 1 and 10. approx. time of build = 3hrs. I wanted to also create a loop that would allow the player to choose to play the game again instead of having to run the file again to play but ran out of time to figure it out. Second commit will be head first rubies example of the number game coded by me with help from the textbook.
